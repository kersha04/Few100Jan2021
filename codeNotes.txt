 === compares types as well, so 10 != '10'
 == means that 10 == '10' 
 same thing for !=, do !== instead

+'10' is the same as parseFloat('10'). probably should just use the explicit

no browser supports typescript. The typescript compiles out to javascript for the browser to run on
describe is context for a group of tests (its)
it is a test
behavior driven development, 'describe' this thing. 'it' can blah blah blah

xdescribe - skips the describe from running
xit skips the single test
fit runs only that test

semi-colons are optional, but omitting them can cause problems. TS lint will add them to your source code

a compiler error might still generate the code, even if there is an error in the code. be careful

search -> mdn search stuff
maybe define the interface if we're using it more than once

anon functions are mostly used as params to higher order functions

do, for, while, but don't loop often because things are in an array, and the array has those methods built in

public, private, protected => public is default

this is not optional in typescript. this.property grabs the class level property
1. Modules - typescript source code files that export something
2. Classes
    - Constructors
    - Fields
    - Methods
    - Inheritance
    - Implementing an interface
3. Imports aplenty. Specifies what source code needs to be compiled and sent to client
    - dlls aren't a big deal for c#, but sending all code to a client to just say something trivial like, welcome, could potentially be a bit much, especially with slow interwebz
        - optimization - send the minimum to the client that allows it to run
        
emmett - 
div is default
.{string} -> class
> -> child of whatever is to the left
+ sibling of whatever is to the left
